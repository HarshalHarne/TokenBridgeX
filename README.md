# TokenBridgeX

## 📝 Project Description

**TokenBridgeX** is a basic token bridge smart contract that facilitates secure token transfers between the Ethereum testnet and Polygon testnet. It simulates a lock-and-release pattern for ERC20 tokens to ensure consistency across two chains.

## 🚀 Project Vision

The long-term vision for TokenBridgeX is to enable trust-minimized interoperability between EVM-compatible chains with a focus on user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi) flows.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Lock ERC20 tokens on the source chain.
- Admin-controlled release on the destination chain.
- Transaction hash tracking to prevent double-spending.
- Upgradeable bridge admin for multi-chain governance.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with Oracle services for tx validation.
- Zero-knowledge proof support for cross-chain validation.
- Automatic mint/burn mechanism with token wrappers.
- Support for NFTs and multi-token formats.
